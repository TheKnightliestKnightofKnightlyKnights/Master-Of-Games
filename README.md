# Master-Of-Games
A personal project for WSCU that wants to imitate the Roll20 website functionality.
# This project will create a mock up of the Roll20 site, found here: https://roll20.net/
# The current features and languages are here: 
		Chat Functionality- There is a text area that can be updated into the text history area(Needs to be larger)
		Base Outline (Game master)- not the player. The page is being created for the Game Master first, as they need the most functionality.
		Assets: Battlemats (4 current maps) - Found from google images, non copyrighted images
		Javascript
		CSS
		HTML

# Planned functionality:
		Dice Rolling- The main staple of Dungeons and Dragons
		Updating tokens(images) to the battlemat- Tokens in this case are players, NPC(non-player characters), and mosters/baddies
		Importing/updating to a new battlemat(main image area)
		Bug reporting- Just a button that will report bugs. Mainly for my testing over the summer
		Better UI- Make the UI look more impressive/user friendly
		Client(palyer) outline/page: The players need their pages that update with the GM, but with less functionality
